# Swagger UI
Disclaimer: This is the current Swagger UI based on the main branch - which may differ from the Swagger UI of this release.
The Swagger UI and `openapi.json` will be available under `{url}:{port}/docs`, in this case `http://localhost:7997/docs`.

Beyond, a test-deployment on Huggingface is deployed here: https://michaelfeil-infinity.hf.space
